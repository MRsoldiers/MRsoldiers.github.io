            "content": "<p>As one of the most common data structures, tabular data may change over time in four types: structural (add/remove), content, reorder, and split/merge (each type is encoded by a consistent and distinguished color across this work). Considering the requirements of inspection and comparison along a set of these changes, this work designs a multilevel visualization framework to provide an overview+detail exploration.</p><p>An important and challenging task when making sense such data is to investigate the difference between multiple versions of a table, for instance, to detect modifications in monthly payroll tables or to observe differences in multiple biological experiments.</p><p>First is timeline overview. Stacked bars placed on the top of time ticks are used to present the ratios of each type of changes between consecutive versions of table. Then the aggregated pairwise comparison applies an abstract and compact visualization to encode the distribution of changes between the tables. It also directly shows meta-information about the table. Furthermore, this work designs a visualization to support detailed pairwise comparison. Pixel-based diff heatmap encodes the four possible change types in a tailored way.</p>",

This work proposes a data-driven approach to plan bike lanes under real world constraints, based on a large scale sharing bikes trajectories.</p><p>The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, which maximizes the total beneficial score, and fulfills two constraints: 1) the total budget is no more than B, and 2) the number of connected components is less than k.</p><p>They prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose greedy-based heuristics to address it, as same as the 0-1 Knapsack problem. The algorithm firstly selects k road segments as the starting edges and then expands the network by iteratively adding the road that has the lowest ratio of the cost and beneficial score, until the budget is insufficient.</p>",

Besides, a tailored visualization consisting mainly of augmented parallel coordinates is also designed to incorporate domain knowledge for further exploration. When the dimensionality of the solution space is large, there will be too many axes in the parallel coordinates display. To tackle this problem, different types of features are computed automatically according to some principles or set by the user manually.</p>",
