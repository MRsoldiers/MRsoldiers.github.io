Considering the requirements of inspection and comparison along a set of these changes, this work designs a multilevel visualization framework to provide an overview+detail exploration.</p><p>An important and challenging task when making sense such data is to investigate the difference between multiple versions of a table, for instance, to detect modifications in monthly payroll tables or to observe differences in multiple biological experiments.</p><p>First is timeline overview. Stacked bars placed on the top of time ticks are used to present the ratios of each type of changes between consecutive versions of table. Then the aggregated pairwise comparison applies an abstract and compact visualization to encode the distribution of changes between the tables. It also directly shows meta-information about the table. Furthermore, this work designs a visualization to support detailed pairwise comparison.
